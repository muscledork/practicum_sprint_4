# practicum_sprint_4
Developing a data web app interactively that reders one dataframe and three plots that visualize data from the vechicles_us.csv file

There is a sidebar that is used for the selection process of each plot. The dataframe and plots are all expandable so you can have all of them open or closed per your preference.
